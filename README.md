# Critter-Log-V2

Welcome to Critter Log (V2)

The Goal:
The goal of this app is to keep track of a critter.

The user:
The app is aimed at a person who takes care of critters. This could be a pet sitter, a pet walker or just a pet owner.

The UI
For this app I wanted to combine my professional knowledge as a UI Designer and UX researcher. The goal was to make the onboarding process as seamless as possible. One of the ways I tried to acheive this goal was to allow the user to add information about the critter when they wanted to. The only required information to create a critter is a name. For the detail view, I watned to give the user the control as to what they see in that view. There is an option view that allows the user to toggle on differnt views. So if for instance the user doesn't want to see the age of the critter, they can simply toggle that off.


The Dev side:
For this app I am using a json file that is created the first time the app runs. When the user creates a critter, the app use theDogAPI to fectch 5 random images and stores them to use for the critter profile. The goal would be to allow the user to replace the random photos with photos of their own.

Saving:
The app is creating a json file to use for each new users. After the json file is created, the app will save each critter to that json file.
